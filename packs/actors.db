The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. </p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). </p><p>You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. </p><p>Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p><p><em>**Foundry note: Note the Other Formula is set to the base default of 1d6 and limited uses is set to the minimum of 1. Additionally, recovery is set to long rest (for levels before @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.3VDZGs5Ug3hIE322]{Font of Inspiration} is gained).

Colleges</h1>\n<h2>College of Lore</h2>\n<p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>\n<p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>\n<p>The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>\n<h3>College of Lore Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.e9ytGikyLFgwZ5wi]{Bonus Proficiencies} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.5zPmHPQUne7RDfaU]{Cutting Words}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.myBu3zi5eYvQIcuy]{Additional Magical Secrets}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.pquwueEMweRhiWaq]{Peerless Skill}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","cha"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["acr","ani","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","nat","prc","per","prf","rel","slt","ste","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ILvRZGEx3aXqSVUt"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/affliction_24.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"MX29mr6A5oqePYyF","name":"Spellcasting (Bard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"11\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Independent Adventurers</span></span> <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"12\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Ranger</span></span> <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p><p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"13\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions.

nature.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Chain. </strong></em>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Blade. </strong></em>If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Tome. </strong></em>Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Otherworldly Patrons</h1>\n<p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p>\n<p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p>\n<h2>The Fiend</h2>\n<p>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.</p>\n<h3>The Fiend Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.4IHsIcBhAVDt8QjY]{Expanded Spell List} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Jv0zu4BtUi8bFCqJ]{Dark One's Blessing }</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.OQSb0bO1yDI4aiMx]{Dark One's Own Luck}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.9UZ2WjUF2k58CQug]{Fiendish Resilience}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.aCUmlnHlUPHS0rdu]{Hurl Through Hell}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"The Genie","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":[],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","inv","nat","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"pact","ability":""},"damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":2100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/violet_21.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"4AxTL2Hflj5UZUft","name":"Pact Magic","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

Archetypes</h1>\n<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Thief</h2>\n<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts.

companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p><p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush.

In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"4\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skill and Precision</span></span> <p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"5\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Shady Living</span></span> <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"6\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law.

Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support.

The few travelers that passed through had my attention.

I admired one of the archeology professors there. He had lived a noteworthy life! The day of graduation he gifted me with a lead to pursue, a relic that was said to give its bearer power over life and death!</p>\n<p>After years in pursuit I beheld the relic I was searching for!

Maybe I can have some abilities from my Wishlist or maybe I can equip them with better weapons &amp; armor? I'm open to ideas here.</p>\n<h1>Wishlist</h1>\n<p>Enhancements in addition to (or possibly in exchange for) normal advancement that would be great for my character.

Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths.

You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p><p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p><p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p><p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p><p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.

You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book’s Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest or temple servant, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.<br /><br /><strong><em>Divine Domain.</em></strong> You draw magic from a divine domain—a sphere of magical influence—associated with your deity. Your domain lets you have certain spells, such as bless and cure wounds, always prepared.<br /><br />Your domain is Life, which is affiliated with many gods of good. Your god, Marthammor Duin, is the dwarf god of wanderers, travelers, and outcasts—those who move among strange lands and foreign peoples. Dwarves who honor him wear his holy symbol, a boot overlaid by an upright mace, on a necklace often made of silver and iron.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn, you traveled to Neverwinter as part of a mercenary company that serves as both army and city watch. You grew disillusioned with your fellow soldiers, who seem to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect. Everything came to a head recently, when you disobeyed an order and followed your conscience. You were suspended from active duty, though you kept your rank and your connection to the mercenaries. Since then, you have devoted yourself to your deity.<br /><br /><em><strong>Personal Goal: Teach the Redbrands a Lesson.</strong></em> You’ve heard that Daran Edermath in the town of Phandalin is looking for people of courage and principle to teach some bullies a lesson. These thugs, the Redbrands, have been throwing their weight around in Phandalin, much as your compatriots did in Neverwinter. Putting a stop to their villainy is a worthy goal.<br /><br /><strong><em>Alignment: Neutral Good.</em></strong> Your conscience, not law and authority, will guide you to do the right thing. Power is meant to be used for the benefit of all, not to oppress the weak.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Gaining Levels</h3>\n<p>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook. With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d8 + 3 to your hit point maximum.<br /><br />You gain access to more spells as you gain levels. You can prepare a number of spells equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier, as shown in the Spellcasting Advancement table. You also gain more spell slots.<br /><br /><strong>Spellcasting Advancement</strong></p>\n<div style=\"margin-left:140px\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</div>\n<table style=\"width:496px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Prepared Spells</strong></td>\n<td><strong>1st</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2nd</strong></td>\n<td><strong>3rd</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Channel Divinity.</em></strong> You can channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel one of two magical effects: Turn Undead or Preserve Life. Both effects require you to use an action and present your holy symbol. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.<br /><br /><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> When you use Turn Undead, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.<br /><br />A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action.<br /><br /><strong><em>Preserve Life.</em></strong> When you use Preserve Life, choose one or more creatures within 30 feet of you to heal, then distribute up to 10 hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. At 3rd level, you can distribute 15 hit points, at 4th level 20, and at 5th level 25.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> You can now prepare and cast 2nd-level spells. In addition to the spells you choose to prepare, you always have two additional domain spells prepared: lesser restoration and spiritual weapon.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> You learn one more cleric cantrip of your choice.<br /><br /><strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> Your Wisdom increases to 18, which has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Wisdom modifier becomes +4.</li>\n<li>Your spell saving throw DC and the DC for your Turn Undead each increase by 1.</li>\n<li>Your bonus for your spell attacks increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Your modifier to Wisdom saving throws increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Your modifier to Wisdom-based skills increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> You can now prepare and cast 3rd-level spells. In addition to the spells you choose to prepare, you always have two additional domain spells prepared: beacon of hope and revivify.<br /><br /><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for your spell attacks and for weapons you’re proficient with.</li>\n<li>Your spell saving throw DC and the DC for your Turn Undead each increase by 1.</li>\n<li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Destroy Undead.</em></strong> When an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is 1/2 or lower.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>Improving Your Armor</h4>\n<p>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class. The rulebook contains equipment, including armor.</p>\n<hr />\n<section>\n<p><strong>Personality Traits :</strong></p>\n<p>I’m always polite and respectful.

mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities.

Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"32\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Divine Agents</span></span> <p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths.

Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.</p><p>Once you've chosen a deity, consider your cleric's relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker?

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.</p><p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p><p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p><p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p><p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"25\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primal Instinct</span></span> <p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p><p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"26\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Life of Danger</span></span> <p>Not every member of the tribes deemed \"barbarians\" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p><p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"27\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Barbarian</span></span> <p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world.

But they are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world, the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.<br /><br />When humans settle somewhere, they stay. They build cities to last for the ages and great kingdoms that can persist for centuries. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.<br /><br />Human culture varies by region. In the Forgotten Realms, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature in the northwestern lands of Neverwinter are different from their counterparts in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east. Human physical characteristics vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Neverwinter have every possible variation of coloration and features.<hr />Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans have no truly typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly). Traditional names among different human cultures vary widely. You might be Haseid (Calishite), Kerri (Chondathan), Kosef (Damaran), Amafrey (Illuskan), So-Kehur (Mulan), Madislak (Rashemi), Mei (Shou), or Salazar (Turami).<hr /><h3>Fighter</h3>Fighters are the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.<hr /><h3>Background</h3>Your parents lived in the prosperous village of Thundertree, east of the city of Neverwinter and at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood. But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents fled, carrying you in your infancy. Your family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as servants or laborers where they could.<br /><br />You’ve spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a porter and laborer at the city’s bustling docks. But it’s clear to you and everyone around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Someday, you’ll come into your own. You’ll be a hero.<br /><br /><strong><em>Personal Goal: Drive Off the Dragon.</em></strong> The ruins of Thundertree call to you. Your family and their friends once lived in prosperity there, and now they’re reduced to menial labor. The ruins are haunted by ash zombies, and rumor has it a dragon has made its lair in the Old Tower, but those are problems a hero can solve. Slay the dragon, or drive it off, and you’ll prove—to yourself and everyone else—you’re a real hero, destined for greatness.<br /><br /><strong><em>Alignment: Lawful Good.</em></strong> A hero stands up to evil and never lets bullies have their way. A hero fights for law and order, so that everyone can live in prosperity and happiness. A hero slays monsters, clears ruins, and protects the innocent. You strive to be such a hero.<hr /><h2>Gaining Levels</h2>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br />With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d10 + 2 to your hit point maximum.<br /><br /><h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4><em><strong>Action Surge.</strong></em> You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.<br />Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.<br /><br /><h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4><strong><em>Improved Critical.</em></strong> Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.<br /><br /><h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4><em><strong>Ability Score Improvement.</strong></em> Your Dexterity increases to 18, which has the following effects:<br /><ul><li>Your Dexterity modifier becomes +4.</li><li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Dexterity-based attacks, such as your longbow, increase by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity saving throws increases by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity-based skills increases by 1.</li><li>While you wear light or no armor, your Armor Class increases by 1.</li><li>Your initiative increases by 1.</li></ul><br /><h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4><strong><em>Extra Attack.</em></strong> Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make two attacks, instead of one, as part of taking that action.<br /><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:<br /><ul><li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you’re proficient with.</li><li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1.</li><li>Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.</li></ul><h4>Improving Your Armor</h4>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class.

/>\n<h3>Your Pact Boon</h3>\n<p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Chain. </strong></em>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Blade. </strong></em>If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Tome. </strong></em>Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Otherworldly Patrons</h1>\n<p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p>\n<p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p>\n<h2>The Fiend</h2>\n<p>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.</p>\n<h3>The Fiend Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.4IHsIcBhAVDt8QjY]{Expanded Spell List} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Jv0zu4BtUi8bFCqJ]{Dark One's Blessing }</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.OQSb0bO1yDI4aiMx]{Dark One's Own Luck}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.9UZ2WjUF2k58CQug]{Fiendish Resilience}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.aCUmlnHlUPHS0rdu]{Hurl Through Hell}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","inv","nat","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"pact","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.7WJp9vhi6F6SlAFa"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/violet_21.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"JwVOjcZIuT5bX0fn","name":"Otherworldly Patron","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being, such as the Fiend.

particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. </p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<h2>Circle of the Land</h2>\n<p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.</p>\n<h3>Circle of the Land Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"lT8GsPOPgRzDC3QJ\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Bonus Cantrip</a> <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"wKdRtFsvGfMKQHLY\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Natural Recovery</a></p>\n<p>3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"YiK59gWSlcQ6Mbdz\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Circle Spells</a></p>\n<p>6th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"3FB25qKxmkmxcxuC\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Land's Stride (Circle of the Land)</a></p>\n<p>10th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"OTvrJSJSUgAwXrWX\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Nature's Ward</a></p>\n<p>14th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"EuX1kJNIw1F68yus\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Nature's Sanctuary</a></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ani","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"ase8bS7TFIu2A5G7","name":"Spellcasting (Druid)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list.

Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">-Spell Slots per Spell Level-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature.

They can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world.<br />Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the centuries with stoic endurance. Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and committed in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness.<br /><br />In the Forgotten Realms, your people are called gold dwarves. They have remote kingdoms in the south and typically keep their distance from human affairs. Their brethren are the shield dwarves of the north, who are strong, hardy, and accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. Years ago, you moved to that northern realm.<hr /><strong>Male Dwarf Names:</strong> Adrik, Baern, Brottor, Dain, Darrak, Eberk, Einkil, Fargrim, Gardain, Harbek, Kildrak, Morgran, Orsik, Rurik, Taklinn, Thoradin, Tordek, Traubon, Travok, Veit, Vondal<br /><br /><strong>Female Dwarf Names:</strong> Amber, Artin, Bardryn, Dagnal, Diesa, Eldeth, Finellen, Gunnloda, Gurdis, Helja, Hlin, Kathra, Kristryd, Ilde, Liftrasa, Mardred, Riswynn, Sannl, Torbera, Torgga, Vistra<br /><br /><strong>Dwarf Clan Names:</strong> Battlehammer, Brawnanvil, Dankil, Frostbeard, Gorunn, Ironfist, Loderr, Strakeln, Torunn, Ungart<hr /><h3>Cleric</h3>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest or temple servant, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.<br /><br /><strong><em>Divine Domain.</em></strong> You draw magic from a divine domain—a sphere of magical influence—associated with your deity. Your domain lets you have certain spells, such as bless and cure wounds, always prepared.<br /><br />Your domain is Life, which is affiliated with many gods of good. Your god, Marthammor Duin, is the dwarf god of wanderers, travelers, and outcasts—those who move among strange lands and foreign peoples. Dwarves who honor him wear his holy symbol, a boot overlaid by an upright mace, on a necklace often made of silver and iron.<hr /><h3>Background</h3>Trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn, you traveled to Neverwinter as part of a mercenary company that serves as both army and city watch. You grew disillusioned with your fellow soldiers, who seem to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect. Everything came to a head recently, when you disobeyed an order and followed your conscience. You were suspended from active duty, though you kept your rank and your connection to the mercenaries. Since then, you have devoted yourself to your deity.<br /><br /><em><strong>Personal Goal: Teach the Redbrands a Lesson.</strong></em> You’ve heard that Daran Edermath in the town of Phandalin is looking for people of courage and principle to teach some bullies a lesson. These thugs, the Redbrands, have been throwing their weight around in Phandalin, much as your compatriots did in Neverwinter. Putting a stop to their villainy is a worthy goal.<br /><br /><strong><em>Alignment: Neutral Good.</em></strong> Your conscience, not law and authority, will guide you to do the right thing. Power is meant to be used for the benefit of all, not to oppress the weak.<hr /><h3>Gaining Levels</h3>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook. With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d8 + 3 to your hit point maximum.<br /><br />You gain access to more spells as you gain levels. You can prepare a number of spells equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier, as shown in the Spellcasting Advancement table. You also gain more spell slots.<br /><br /><strong>Spellcasting Advancement</strong><br /><div style=\"margin-left:140px\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</div><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Prepared Spells</strong></td><td><strong>1st</strong></td><td><strong>2nd</strong></td><td><strong>3rd</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4><strong><em>Channel Divinity.</em></strong> You can channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel one of two magical effects: Turn Undead or Preserve Life. Both effects require you to use an action and present your holy symbol. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.<br /><br /><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> When you use Turn Undead, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.<br /><br />A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action.<br /><br /><strong><em>Preserve Life.</em></strong> When you use Preserve Life, choose one or more creatures within 30 feet of you to heal, then distribute up to 10 hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. At 3rd level, you can distribute 15 hit points, at 4th level 20, and at 5th level 25.<br /><br /><h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> You can now prepare and cast 2nd-level spells. In addition to the spells you choose to prepare, you always have two additional domain spells prepared: lesser restoration and spiritual weapon.<br /><br /><h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> You learn one more cleric cantrip of your choice.<br /><br /><strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> Your Wisdom increases to 18, which has the following effects:<br /><ul><li>Your Wisdom modifier becomes +4.</li><li>Your spell saving throw DC and the DC for your Turn Undead each increase by 1.</li><li>Your bonus for your spell attacks increases by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Wisdom saving throws increases by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Wisdom-based skills increases by 1.</li><li>Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.</li></ul><h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> You can now prepare and cast 3rd-level spells. In addition to the spells you choose to prepare, you always have two additional domain spells prepared: beacon of hope and revivify.<br /><br /><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:<br /><ul><li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for your spell attacks and for weapons you’re proficient with.</li><li>Your spell saving throw DC and the DC for your Turn Undead each increase by 1.</li><li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1.</li></ul><strong><em>Destroy Undead.</em></strong> When an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is 1/2 or lower.<br /><br /><h4>Improving Your Armor</h4>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class.

Archetypes</h1>\n<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Thief</h2>\n<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p>\n<h3>Thief Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ga3dt2zrCn2MHK8R]{Fast Hands} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.FGrbXs6Ku5qxFK5G]{Second-Story Work}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Ei1Oh4UAA2E30jcD]{Supreme Sneak}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.NqWyHE7Rpw9lyKWu]{Use Magic Device}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.LhRm1EeUMvp2EWhV]{Thief's Reflexes}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","per","prf","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.xEb8jmA5HlNs7xTF"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/gray_04.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"kRWtiPib9MRx9JmN","name":"Dagger (offhand)","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A short metal blade mounted to a small hilt and crossguard.

that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"17\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Cause of Righteousness</span></span> <p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"18\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beyond the Mundane Life</span></span> <p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"19\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Paladin</span></span> <p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p><p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p><p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"20\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions.

Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent.

But they are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world, the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.<br /><br />When humans settle somewhere, they stay. They build cities to last for the ages and great kingdoms that can persist for centuries. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.<br /><br />Human culture varies by region. In the Forgotten Realms, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature in the northwestern lands of Neverwinter are different from their counterparts in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east. Human physical characteristics vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Neverwinter have every possible variation of coloration and features.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans have no truly typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly). Traditional names among different human cultures vary widely. You might be Haseid (Calishite), Kerri (Chondathan), Kosef (Damaran), Amafrey (Illuskan), So-Kehur (Mulan), Madislak (Rashemi), Mei (Shou), or Salazar (Turami).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Fighter</h3>\n<p>Fighters are the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Your parents lived in the prosperous village of Thundertree, east of the city of Neverwinter and at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood. But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents fled, carrying you in your infancy. Your family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as servants or laborers where they could.<br /><br />You’ve spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a porter and laborer at the city’s bustling docks. But it’s clear to you and everyone around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Someday, you’ll come into your own. You’ll be a hero.<br /><br /><strong><em>Personal Goal: Drive Off the Dragon.</em></strong> The ruins of Thundertree call to you. Your family and their friends once lived in prosperity there, and now they’re reduced to menial labor. The ruins are haunted by ash zombies, and rumor has it a dragon has made its lair in the Old Tower, but those are problems a hero can solve. Slay the dragon, or drive it off, and you’ll prove—to yourself and everyone else—you’re a real hero, destined for greatness.<br /><br /><strong><em>Alignment: Lawful Good.</em></strong> A hero stands up to evil and never lets bullies have their way. A hero fights for law and order, so that everyone can live in prosperity and happiness. A hero slays monsters, clears ruins, and protects the innocent. You strive to be such a hero.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Gaining Levels</h2>\n<p>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br />With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d10 + 2 to your hit point maximum.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4>\n<p><em><strong>Action Surge.</strong></em> You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.

An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p><p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p><p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p><p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"186\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Well-Rounded Specialists</span></span> <p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"187\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trained for Danger</span></span> <p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p><p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"188\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Fighter</span></span> <p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p><p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"189\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions.

that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"17\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Cause of Righteousness</span></span> <p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"18\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beyond the Mundane Life</span></span> <p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"19\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Paladin</span></span> <p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p><p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p><p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"20\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions.

To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p><p>Multiple variations of this item exist, as listed below:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#amulet_phb\" data-plut-hover=\"{&quot;page&quot;:&quot;items.html&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;phb&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;amulet_phb&quot;}\">Amulet</a></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#emblem_phb\" data-plut-hover=\"{&quot;page&quot;:&quot;items.html&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;phb&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;emblem_phb&quot;}\">Emblem</a></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#reliquary_phb\" data-plut-hover=\"{&quot;page&quot;:&quot;items.html&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;phb&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;reliquary_phb&quot;}\">Reliquary</a></li></ul></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":null,"attuned":false,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"None","identified":false,"damage":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"guWau9q2dgQKp917":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"items.html","source":"PHB","hash":"holy%20symbol_phb"}}},{"_id":"g0t5fzXfHJjKLycz","name":"Javelin","type":"weapon","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/items/weapons/bolt.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"flex-col\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"split mb-1\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"italic\">Weapon</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"no-wrap \"></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"italic\">Simple weapon, melee weapon</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"flex w-100\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-4\">5 sp, 2 lb.</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-8 text-right\">[[/r 1d6]] piercing  - thrown (30/120 ft.)</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<hr />\n\t\t<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"21\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Thrown.</span></span> <p>If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.<br /><br />Elves can live over 700 years. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance, and they trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence.<br /><br />Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals, which they have no interest in mining.<br /><br />In the Forgotten Realms, your people are named sun elves. Also called gold elves or sunrise elves, sun elves have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond, and their eyes are golden, silver, or black. They are more reclusive than the other branch of high elves, the moon elves, but Oghma has called you to live among other peoples, rather than in the sanctuaries of your kin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, sometime after the hundredth birthday. Before this period, they are called by child names. On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name. Every elf also bears a family name, typically a combination of Elvish words. Some elves traveling among other races translate their family names into Common.<br /><br /><strong>Child Names:</strong> Ara, Bryn, Del, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Syllin, Vall<br /><br /><strong>Male Adult Names:</strong> Adran, Berrian, Carric, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Immeral, Paelias, Quarion, Riardon, Soveliss, Theren, Varis<br /><br /><strong>Female Adult Names:</strong> Althaea, Bethrynna, Caelynn, Ielenia, Leshanna, Meriele, Naivara, Quillathe, Silaqui, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia<br /><br /><strong>Family Names (Common Translations):</strong> Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Wizard</h2>\n<p>Wizards are supreme magic-users. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, they cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. The mightiest wizards learn to conjure elementals from other planes of existence, glimpse the future, or turn slain foes into zombies.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>You have spent your life dedicated to Oghma, all-seeing god of knowledge, and spent years learning the lore of the multiverse.<br /><br /><strong><em>Personal Goal: Reconsecrate the Defiled Altar.</em></strong> Through visions delivered in your trances, your god has called you to a new mission. A goblin tribe has made its lair in an ancient ruin now called Cragmaw Castle, where they have defiled a shrine once sacred to Oghma. Now dedicated to the vile goblin god Maglubiyet, the altar is an offense to Oghma that must not stand.<br /><br />You’re sure Oghma has greater things in store for you if you can complete this quest. In the meantime, your visions suggest that Sister Garaele—a priest of Tymora, the goddess of luck—can aid you in the town of Phandalin.<br /><br /><strong><em>Alignment: Chaotic Good.</em></strong> The pursuit and acquisition of knowledge is for the benefit of all. Kingdoms and laws are useful so far as they allow knowledge to flourish. Tyrants who seek to suppress and control it are the worst villains. You share your knowledge freely, and use what you have learned to help where you can.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Gaining Levels</h2>\n<p>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br /><br />With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d6 + 2 to your hit point maximum.<br /><br />You gain access to more spells as you gain levels. You can prepare a number of spells equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier, as shown in the Spellcasting Advancement table. You also gain more spell slots.<br /><strong><br />Spellcasting Advancement</strong></p>\n<div style=\"margin-left:160px\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</div>\n<table style=\"width:496px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Prepared Spells</strong></td>\n<td><strong>1st</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2nd</strong></td>\n<td><strong>3rd</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Adding to Your Spellbook</h4>\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook, chosen from the wizard spell list in the rulebook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. On your adventures, you might also find scrolls or books containing other spells you can add to your spellbook.<br /><br /><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.<br /><br />For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and requires 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Evocation Savant.</em></strong> The gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.<br /><br /><em><strong>Sculpt Spells.</strong></em> When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage from it.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4>\n<p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> You can now prepare and cast 2nd-level spells.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong>. You learn one more wizard cantrip of your choice.<br /><strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> Your Intelligence increases to 18, which has the following effects:<br />• Your Intelligence modifier becomes +4.<br />• Your spell saving throw DC increases by 1.<br />• Your bonus for your spell attacks increases by 1.<br />• Your modifier to Intelligence saving throws increases by 1.<br />• Your modifier to Intelligence-based skills increases by 1.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> You can prepare and cast 3rd-level spells.<br /><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:<br />• Your attack bonus increases by 1 for your spell attacks and weapons you’re proficient with.<br />• Your spell saving throw DC increases by 1.<br />• Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1.<br />• Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.</p>\n<hr />\n<section>\n<p><strong>Personality Traits :</strong></p>\n<p>I use polysyllabic words that convey the impression of erudition.

Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.</p><p>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p><p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p><p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"70\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Scholars of the Arcane</span></span> <p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p><p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"71\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Lure of Knowledge</span></span> <p>Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p><p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"72\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Wizard</span></span> <p>Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event.

Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?</p><p>What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard?

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p>\n<p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>\n<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance.

Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an old dirt road.<br /><br />The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation.<br /><br />Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship, as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations.<br /><br /><strong>Male Names:</strong> Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby<br /><br /><strong>Female Names: </strong>Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna<br /><br /><strong>Family Names:</strong> Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Rogue</h3>\n<p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>The town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of an older settlement, vacant for five centuries until some hardy settlers set about rebuilding it some years back. Drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the nearby foothills, you came to Phandalin as well, not to earn a living, but to prey on those who struck it rich. You joined a gang calling itself the Redbrands and made some decent coin as a burglar, enforcer, or fence.<br /><br />But you must have made an enemy among your fellow Redbrands. Someone set you up. On that person’s word, the head of the Redbrands—a wizard called Glasstaff—tried to have you killed. You escaped, barely alive and thanking Tymora, the goddess of good fortune, for your luck. You fled Phandalin, almost penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name.<br /><br /><em><strong>Personal Goal:</strong></em> Get Your Revenge. Someone in the Redbrands nearly got you killed, and you sure would like to know who it was. And then you’d like to take your revenge—on that person, on Glasstaff, maybe on all the Redbrands. And you just got a tip that might help you: someone named Halia Thornton also has it out for the Redbrands. She lives in Phandalin, which means showing your face to the Redbrands who still want you dead.<br /><br /><em><strong>Alignment: Neutral.</strong></em> You tend to do whatever seems best at the time. Sure, you’ve done some things you’re not proud of, and you’re not personally committed to making the world a better place. But you have no interest in causing suffering or making things worse than they already are.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Gaining Levels</h3>\n<p>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br /><br />With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d8 + 1 to your hit point maximum.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Cunning Action.</em></strong> Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly, so you can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Second-Story Work.</em></strong> You gain the ability to climb faster than normal, so climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.<br /><br /><strong><em>Fast Hands.</em></strong> You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, take the Use an Object action, or use your thieves’ tools to try to disarm a trap or open a lock.<br /><br /><strong><em>Sneak Attack.</em></strong> You deal 2d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 1d6.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> Your Dexterity increases to 18, which has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Dexterity modifier becomes +4.</li>\n<li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Dexterity-based attacks, such as your shortsword and shortbow, increase by 1.</li>\n<li>Your modifier to Dexterity saving throws increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Your modifier to Dexterity-based skills increases by 1.</li>\n<li>While you wear light or no armor, your Armor Class increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Your initiative increases by 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you’re proficient with.</li>\n<li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1. Your Expertise feature means your bonus for Stealth and the use of thieves’ tools instead each increase by 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Sneak Attack.</em></strong> You deal 3d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 2d6.<br /><br /><strong><em>Uncanny Dodge.</em></strong> When an attacker you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>Improving Your Armor</h4>\n<p>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class.

Drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the nearby foothills, you came to Phandalin as well, not to earn a living, but to prey on those who struck it rich. You joined a gang calling itself the Redbrands and made some decent coin as a burglar, enforcer, or fence.</p>\n<p>But you must have made an enemy among your fellow Redbrands. Someone set you up. On that person’s word, the head of the Redbrands—a wizard called Glasstaff—tried to have you killed. You escaped, barely alive and thanking Tymora, the goddess of good fortune, for your luck. You fled Phandalin, almost penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Personal Goal: Get Your Revenge. Someone in the Redbrands nearly got you killed, and you sure would like to know who it was. And then you’d like to take your revenge—on that person, on Glasstaff, maybe on all the Redbrands. And you just got a tip that might help you: someone named Halia Thornton also has it out for the Redbrands. She lives in Phandalin, which means showing your face to the Redbrands who still want you dead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alignment: Neutral. You tend to do whatever seems best at the time. Sure, you’ve done some things you’re not proud of, and you’re not personally committed to making the world a better place. But you have no interest in causing suffering or making things worse than they already are.</p>\n</section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"Halfling (Lightfoot)","background":"Criminal","originalClass":"12m0lYsEZafqmjCF","xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":300,"pct":0},"appearance":"","trait":"I never have a plan, but I’m great at making things up as I go along.

She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p><p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p><p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"118\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skill and Precision</span></span> <p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"119\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Shady Living</span></span> <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"120\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"121\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions.

that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"17\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Cause of Righteousness</span></span> <p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"18\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beyond the Mundane Life</span></span> <p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"19\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Paladin</span></span> <p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p><p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p><p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"20\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions.

But they are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world, the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.<br /><br />When humans settle somewhere, they stay. They build cities to last for the ages and great kingdoms that can persist for centuries. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.<br /><br />Human culture varies by region. In the Forgotten Realms, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature in the northwestern lands of Neverwinter are different from their counterparts in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east. Human physical characteristics vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Neverwinter have every possible variation of coloration and features.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans have no truly typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly). Traditional names among different human cultures vary widely. You might be Haseid (Calishite), Kerri (Chondathan), Kosef (Damaran), Amafrey (Illuskan), So-Kehur (Mulan), Madislak (Rashemi), Mei (Shou), or Salazar (Turami).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Fighter</h3>\n<p>Fighters are the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Your family is no stranger to wealth, power, and privilege. In the glory days of Neverwinter, your parents were the count and countess of Corlinn Hill, a large estate located in the hills northeast of the city. But Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, devastating Neverwinter and erasing Corlinn Hill from the map. Instead of growing up on an estate, you were raised in a small but comfortable town house in Waterdeep. As an adult, you stand to inherit a meaningless title and little else.<br /><strong><em><br />Personal Goal: Civilize Phandalin.</em></strong> You were meant for more than being a ruler of nothing at all. Rebuilding Corlinn Hill is impractical, thanks to the volcano. But in the last three or four years, hardy settlers have been rebuilding another ruin near the city: the old town of Phandalin, which orcs sacked five centuries ago. Clearly, what Phandalin needs now is a civilizing influence—someone to take the reins and bring law and order. Someone like you.<br /><br />You’re not the only one with such ideas. A knight named Sildar Hallwinter recently set out for Phandalin in the company of a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker. They plan to reclaim an ancient mine and restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity. Since your goals align, Hallwinter should be willing to assist you.<br /><br /><strong><em>Alignment: Lawful Neutral.</em></strong> It’s essential to establish law and order, even if it takes an iron fist to do it. The nobility are bound by honor and tradition to protect their people from both external and internal threats to stability. An organized society leaves no room for evil and chaos to take root.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Gaining Levels</h2>\n<p>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br />With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d10 + 2 to your hit point maximum.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4>\n<p><em><strong>Action Surge.</strong></em> You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.<br />Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Improved Critical.</em></strong> Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4>\n<p><em><strong>Ability Score Improvement.</strong></em> Your Strength increases to 18, which has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Strength modifier becomes +4.</li>\n<li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Strength-based attacks, such as your greataxe and javelin, increase by 1.</li>\n<li>Your modifier to Strength saving throws increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Your modifier to Athletics increases by 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Extra Attack.</em></strong> Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make two attacks, instead of one, as part of taking that action.<br /><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you’re proficient with.</li>\n<li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Improving Your Armor</h4>\n<p>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class.

An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p><p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p><p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p><p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"208\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Well-Rounded Specialists</span></span> <p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"209\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trained for Danger</span></span> <p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p><p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"210\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Fighter</span></span> <p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p><p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"211\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype.

Whether hidden and protected by a secret sect or the lineage has been forgotten over time, it is said that there are some key signs that can be used to identify the rightful heir. Knowing these signs is one of the single pieces of information that members of the Order of the Hidden Child <em>will not share with others</em>.</p>\n<p>The hope that the Warforged represent of the restoration of a dissolved empire is for others a reminder of a memory that should have been eliminated a long time ago. Because of these unknown enemies, and the many other dangers that exist throughout the lands, members of the Order have to train (or retrain) to protect themselves and learn how to work with and gain the trust of others. He is a fighter by design and through study and training learned the power of sigils carved into parts of his body, armor, or weapons, that grant him select arcane powers \"borrowed\" from giants, trolls, dwarves, and others.</p>\n<p>Rust-E-Liam has been sent to the Marshes on assignment, not for any particular reason other than it's been some time since anyone of the order has been here, and any records (or memories) of previous excursions have been lost or forgotten. It's basically a routine mission with no specific goal other than \"canvas the area in search of clues, investigate to one's ability, and report.\"</p>\n<p>In the Drowned Caves, Rust-E absorbed a runic power that granted him a +2 to Dex. (already included in the ability score).</p>\n<h2>Directives:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make friends.</li>\n<li>Find gainful employement that allows exploration throughout the region (Tiger Squad).</li>\n<li>Work to establish order as possible similar to that of the expired empire.</li>\n<li>Pursue leads (of information) that may lead to the restoration/recovery of relics of the empire, finding the heir, or keys of his/her identification.</li>\n<li>Live long enough to return and report. Comromise is allowed as long as it does not tarnish the standing of the Order.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Character Approach</h2>\n<p>Be resourceful in use of abilities, tools, and resources. Time is on your side.</p>\n<p>Fighting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are primarily a melee combatant. The dancing sword provides a minimal ranged option (Keep in mind it falls to the ground after attacking 4 times). <br />\n<ul>\n<li>Do not forget that you have the ability to use your bandolier as a bonus action once per combat. This is essentially 5 bonus action attacks per combat (with the dancing sword).  - keep the dancing sword active (on targets opposite side to maintain combat advantage).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Use Rune active abilities when they will be the most effective.

Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic.

A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p><p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them.

Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an old dirt road.<br /><br />The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation.<br /><br />Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship, as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.<hr />A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations.<br /><br /><strong>Male Names:</strong> Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby<br /><br /><strong>Female Names: </strong>Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna<br /><br /><strong>Family Names:</strong> Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough<hr /><h3>Rogue</h3>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem.<hr /><h3>Background</h3>The town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of an older settlement, vacant for five centuries until some hardy settlers set about rebuilding it some years back. Drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the nearby foothills, you came to Phandalin as well, not to earn a living, but to prey on those who struck it rich. You joined a gang calling itself the Redbrands and made some decent coin as a burglar, enforcer, or fence.<br /><br />But you must have made an enemy among your fellow Redbrands. Someone set you up. On that person’s word, the head of the Redbrands—a wizard called Glasstaff—tried to have you killed. You escaped, barely alive and thanking Tymora, the goddess of good fortune, for your luck. You fled Phandalin, almost penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name.<br /><br /><em><strong>Personal Goal:</strong></em> Get Your Revenge. Someone in the Redbrands nearly got you killed, and you sure would like to know who it was. And then you’d like to take your revenge—on that person, on Glasstaff, maybe on all the Redbrands. And you just got a tip that might help you: someone named Halia Thornton also has it out for the Redbrands. She lives in Phandalin, which means showing your face to the Redbrands who still want you dead.<br /><br /><em><strong>Alignment: Neutral.</strong></em> You tend to do whatever seems best at the time. Sure, you’ve done some things you’re not proud of, and you’re not personally committed to making the world a better place. But you have no interest in causing suffering or making things worse than they already are.<hr /><h3>Gaining Levels</h3>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br /><br />With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d8 + 1 to your hit point maximum.<br /><br /><h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4><strong><em>Cunning Action.</em></strong> Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly, so you can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.<br /><br /><h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4><strong><em>Second-Story Work.</em></strong> You gain the ability to climb faster than normal, so climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.<br /><br /><strong><em>Fast Hands.</em></strong> You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, take the Use an Object action, or use your thieves’ tools to try to disarm a trap or open a lock.<br /><br /><strong><em>Sneak Attack.</em></strong> You deal 2d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 1d6.<br /><br /><h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4><strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> Your Dexterity increases to 18, which has the following effects:<br /><ul><li>Your Dexterity modifier becomes +4.</li><li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Dexterity-based attacks, such as your shortsword and shortbow, increase by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity saving throws increases by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity-based skills increases by 1.</li><li>While you wear light or no armor, your Armor Class increases by 1.</li><li>Your initiative increases by 1.</li></ul><br /><h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:<br /><ul><li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you’re proficient with.</li><li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1. Your Expertise feature means your bonus for Stealth and the use of thieves’ tools instead each increase by 2.</li></ul><strong><em>Sneak Attack.</em></strong> You deal 3d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 2d6.<br /><br /><strong><em>Uncanny Dodge.</em></strong> When an attacker you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.<br /><br /><h4>Improving Your Armor</h4>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class. The rulebook contains equipment, including armor.<br />\n<hr /><section><p><strong>Personality Traits :</strong> </p><p>I never have a plan, but I’m great at making things up as I go along.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial.

companions.</p><p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.</p><p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Healers and Warriors</span></span> <p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"8\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Divine Agents</span></span> <p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"9\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Cleric</span></span> <p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody.

Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.</p><p>Once you've chosen a deity, consider your cleric's relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker?
